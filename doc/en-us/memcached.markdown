If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with leveraging [MySQL](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/mysql) and [memcached](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/memcached). Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.

This was a pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past. [Twitter](http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/6/27/scaling-twitter-making-twitter-10000-percent-faster.html) and [Digg](http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/4/4/digg-architecture.html) started in this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.

With a little perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still ride horses. Some still use CDs. And the Internet will not completely replace that archaic electro-magnetic broadcast technology called TV, but the majority will move on into a new era.
