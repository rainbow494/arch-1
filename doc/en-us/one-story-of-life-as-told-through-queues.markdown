<div>Love this little example of the human condition from [John Kellden](https://plus.google.com/101010252943098026073/posts/iQAaFLeDHV1) via [Ilya Grigorik](https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/Yzoq5nm2o1p). This happens so often to me shopping at Costco or making lane changes on the highway or picking stocks. Sometimes it's just never the right line and trying to make it better only makes it worse. Stick and stay. Buy and hold. Live to queue another day.</div>
