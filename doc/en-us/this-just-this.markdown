<div>In response to an honest comment about some of Instagram's rather "ordinary engineering choices", mikeyk (Co-founder @ Instagram) had what I consider the [perfect response](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9894975): </div>

> <div>We (at IG) aren't claiming to be doing revolutionary things on infrastructure--**but one thing I found super valuable when scaling Instagram in the early days was having access to stories from other companies on how they've scaled**. That's the spirit in which I encourage our engineers to blog about our DB scaling, our search infra, etc--I think the more open we are (as a company, but more broadly as an industry) about technical approaches + solutions, the better off we'll be.</div>
