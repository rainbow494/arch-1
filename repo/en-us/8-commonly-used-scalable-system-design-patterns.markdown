[Ricky Ho](http://www.blogger.com/profile/03793674536997651667) in [Scalable System Design Patterns](http://horicky.blogspot.com/2010/10/scalable-system-design-patterns.html) has created a great list of scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary of the patterns are:

1.  **Load Balancer** - a dispatcher determines which worker instance will handle a request based on different policies.
2.  **Scatter and Gather** - a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the client.
3.  **Result Cache** - a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.
4.  **Shared Space** - all workers monitors information from the shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.
5.  **Pipe and Filter** - all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.
6.  **MapReduce** -  targets batch jobs where disk I/O is the major bottleneck. It use a distributed file system so that disk I/O can be done in parallel.
7.  **Bulk Synchronous Parallel** - a  lock-step execution across all workers, coordinated by a master.
8.  **Execution Orchestrator **- an intelligent scheduler / orchestrator schedules ready-to-run tasks (based on a dependency graph) across a clusters of dumb workers.
