Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set of [Notes on Scalability](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/01/notes-on-scalability/), just in case you do reach your wildest expectations of success:

1.  **Build it to Break**. Plan for the fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are independent and redundant.
2.  **Everything is a Feature**. Your application is a set of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering trade-offs. 
3.  **Scale Out, Not Up**. Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding and managing horizontal resources. 
4.  **Buy More Storage**. Large numbers of smaller, faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives.
5.  **You’re Going to Do It Wrong**. Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.

Please read the [original article](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/01/notes-on-scalability/) for a much more expansive treatment.
