## [Behind The Scenes of Google Scalability](/blog/2008/4/23/behind-the-scenes-of-google-scalability.html)

    

    The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing systems, and to explore future opportunities.  

Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:  

• Hardware infrastructure  
• Distributed systems infrastructure:  
–Scheduling system  
–GFS  
–BigTable  
–MapReduce  
• Challenges and Future Directions  
–Infrastructure that spans all datacenters  
–More automation  

It is really like a "How does Google work" presentation in ~60 slides?
