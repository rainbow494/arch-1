Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please comment on that too.

Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work. Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard work. Not something most will do willingly. Humans are event driven. It's these events that help us all build better stuff. And that's a good thing.

 The big list of scalability conferences (in no particular order):

1.  [Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/). Meetups are the coffee houses of the enlightenment era, instead of coffee, there's pizza and sometimes beer.

Here in Sillycon Valley, for example,  Sebastian runs the excellent [Cloud Computing Group Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/cloudcomputing/members/4552925/).
