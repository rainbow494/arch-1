It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail. While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And where does random chance get its content? From people like these. So: **support your local blog!**

If you would like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:

*   [DevOps Cafe](http://devopscafe.org/). With this _new video series where John and Damon visit high performing companies and record an insider's tour of the tools and processes those companies are using to solve their DevOps problems_, DevOps is a profession that finally seems to be realizing their own value. In the first episode John Paul Ramirez takes the crew on a tour of Shopzilla's application lifecycle metrics and dashboard. The second episode feature John Allspaw, VP of Technical Operations at Etsy, talking about the new role of DevOps in companies. Only more good stuff from there.
*   [Packet Pushers](http://packetpushers.net/).A great podcast by real experts on seriously technical networking issues_._ They describe their podcast as: _a podcast where we talk about routing, switching, security, firewalls, study and market changes_. Some topics  covered: “Defense in Depth” and what it really means; Deep Diving on Data Centre Switching; Chewing on DDOS; Enterprise MPLS; Career Progression.
