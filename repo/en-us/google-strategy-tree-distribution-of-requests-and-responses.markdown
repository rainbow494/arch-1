If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node then that root node can become overwhelmed:

*   The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal with the flood of requests.
*   The network interface becomes a bottleneck because a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an undisciplined system.

One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr. [Jeff Dean](http://research.google.com/people/jeff/index.html), Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this [Stanford video presentation](http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/101110-ee380-300.asx): **Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses**.

Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes. Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of the leaf nodes.

With this solution:

*   **Fan-in at each level of the tree is manageable**. The CPU cost of processing requests and responses is spread out across all the parents, which reduces the CPU and network bottlenecks.
*   **Response filtering and data reduction**. Ideally the parent can provide a level of response filtering so the root only sees a subset of the response data. This further reduces the network and CPU needed by the root.
*   **Collocation**. The parent can be collocated with leaves on one rack, which keeps all that traffic off your datacenter networks. 

In Google's search system, for example:

*   Leaves generate their best 10 or 15 responses.
*   Parents return the best 20-30 responses out of the 30 leaves the parent is responsible for.
*   This is a large degree of data reduction compared to the case the root had to process all that data directly.
