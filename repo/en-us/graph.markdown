At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.

Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.

Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.

That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their [plumbing](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing) package ([code examples](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing/blob/master/test/plumbing/graph_examples_test.clj)), which is described in an excellent post: [Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation](http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2013/2/1/graph-abstractions-for-structured-computation).

You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on HighScalability: [Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/7/30/prismatic-architecture-using-machine-learning-on-social-netw.html). We learned how Prismatic, an interest driven content suggestion service, builds programs in terms of graph stuff:
