    Linus Torvalds in his usual politically correct way made a typically understated statement about “pushing the whole parallelism snake-oil” that generated almost no response whatsoever.    

    Well, not quite. His comment on     [    Avoiding ping pong    ](http://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=146066&curpostid=146227)     has generated hundreds of responses, both on the original post and     [    on Reddit    ](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2qsqus/linus_the_whole_lets_parallelize_thing_is_a_huge/)    .

There's this huge body of "knowledge" that parallel is somehow more efficient, and that whole huge body is pure and utter garbage. Big caches are efficient. Parallel stupid small cores without caches are horrible unless you have a very specific load that is hugely regular (ie graphics).

End users are fine with roughly on the order of four cores, and you can't fit any more anyway without using too much energy to be practical in that space. And nobody sane would make the cores smaller and weaker in order to fit more of them - the only reason to make them smaller and weaker is because you want to go even further down in power use, so you'd still not have lots of those weak cores.

An interesting question to ponder on the cusp of a new year. What will programs look like in the future? Very different than they look today? Or pretty much the same?

    From the variety of replies to Linus it's obvious we are in no danger of arriving at consensus. There was the usual discussion of the differences between distributed, parallel, concurrent, and multithreading, with each succeeding explanation more confusing than the next. The general gist being that how you describe a problem in code is not how it has to run.  Which is why I was not surprised to see a mini-language war erupt.     

    The idea is parallelization is a problem only because of the old fashioned languages that are used. Use a better language and parallelization of the design can be separated from the runtime and it will all just magically work. There are echoes here of how datacenter architectures are now utilizing schedulers like Mesos to treat entire datacenters as a programmable fabric.     

    One of the more interesting issues raised in the comments was a confusion over what exactly is a server? Can a desktop machine that needs to run fast parallel builds be considered a server? An unsatisfying definition of a not-server may simply be a device that can comfortably run applications that aren't highly parallelized.     

    I pulled out some of the more representative comments from the threads for your enjoyment. The consensus? There is none, but it's quite an interesting discussion...

>     We have not even really started on this re-education of programmers so that they do things in a better way (where "better" means using abstractions that are a better match for parallel programming). Our languages, APIs, and tools are still in an abysmal state, like we're using Fortran and so trying to force recursion or pointers into the language is like pulling teeth. Our tools don't have the sort of refactoring that today makes us not care about needing to add a new parameter to a chain of function calls. etc etc.

>     It all depends on volume and rate of change. When volumes are low and/or the algorithm set is unstable you use commodity HW, of which the flavor of the decade is the GPU. When the volumes get higher and the algorithms more stable it pays to do custom HW (the fixed costs of a moderately complex ASIC on a modern processes are O($10M) or higher when all is said and done, so you can do the math and figure out when it makes sense).    
> 
>     If the volumes are high but the algorithms are only partially stable, then it can make sense to do an ASIC that incorporates both fixed-function HW and programmability in the form of DSPs/GPUs/whatever. That's why Qualcomm sprinkles those 'Hexagon' doohickeys in all of their Snapdragons.

>     It is possible that Linus is both right and wrong at the same time. In fact I'd observe that people have been expecting for a while that fundamentally new languages were going to be necessary to really take advantage of the parallel hardware, so it's not like this is a new thought. We don't just need languages that make it "possible, if you put a lot of work into it and fundamentally fight the language's default structure", we need languages that make it the "easy default case to parallelize where possible". We are, at best, just starting to walk through that door. We do not have these languages in hand. (And I say this despite some fairly extensive experience in the languages you'd consider today's best options. We're just starting.)

>     In today's mobile world "fast enough" might not be the end of it all as far as optimization goes. Since most computing devices now run on batteries making something that's fast enough for the user perception faster is actually an important goal: it allows you to save power. In this respect certain parallel methods provide a bad trade-off: all else being equal they can improve the overall speed of execution at the cost of increased computation (and often communication) over an equivalent serial approach. Now in practice not everything outside of computation is equal so you've got fixed costs to amortize too and overall faster execution might be more efficient nevertheless; but this just to point out that there's more variables to take into account nowadays when deciding if a workload needs to be sped up or not.

>     Parallelism is also still important on mobile, where a lot of stuff is going. The reason being is that getting the complete job done in a shorter time so you can go into power-save mode is nicer on the battery than partially using the CPU for longer. So you saturate it with parallel tasks to get everything done sooner.

>     We have waited. We have seen. The parallel everything idea really took hold when clock speeds stopped increasing 10 years ago. Since then we have seen multiple cores with shared cache. It is tempting since the cache takes a lot of space and synchronizing dedicated caches without slowing them down is difficult. The problem is that each core then doesn't run the same speed as a single core would. It has to fight over the limited shared cache and suffers more cache misses and slows down.

I hope I'm not being too liberal with Linus's words when I interpret this sort of thing as what he meant by "server side". If he has 4 cores, he can get all four blasting on 1/4 of the workload without worrying about changing the workload itself, since the units of work are (presumably) mostly independent of each other.

My gut feeling is that we are at or near "peak parallel" for the time being, until some large innovation comes along that turns computing on its head.

This alone is worth learning how to better parallelize software.

Not many algorithms can exploit this. Whereas concurrent programming is more immediately useful for a broader selection of problems. In this case, multi-core computing takes form as a collection of non-blocking and asynchronous design patterns. I think concurrent programming will become increasingly dominant in the future.

> When talking about concurrent access to data structures it is very important to separate query from mutation. If data structures are immutable, or support concurrent non-blocking reads, then these can scale very well in parallel and can be reasoned about. Concurrent update to any remotely interesting data structure, let alone full model, is very very complex and difficult to manage. Period. Leaving aside the complexity, any concurrent update from multiple writers to a shared model/state is fundamentally limited as proven by Universal Scalability Law (USL)[2]. As an industry we are kidding ourselves if we think it is a good idea to have concurrent update from multiple writers to any model when we expect it to scale in our increasing multi-core world. The good thing is that the majority of application code that needs to be developed is queries against models that do not mutate that often.

> A nasty consequence of our industry desire to have concurrent access to shared state is that we also do it synchronously and that spreads to a distributed context. We need to embrace the world as being asynchronous as a way to avoid the latency constraints in our approaches to design and algorithms. By being asynchronous we can be non-blocking and set our applications free to perform better and be more resilient due to enforced isolation. Bandwidth will continue to improve at a great rate but latency improvements are leveling off.

Oh yes, and don't be so shy about allowing lower level access from the likes of Java, we are well beyond writing applets that run in browser sandboxes these days!
