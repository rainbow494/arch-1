## [Papers: Readings in DistributedÂ Systems](/blog/2009/1/19/papers-readings-in-distributed-systems.html)

    

    Marton Trencseni has collected a wonderful list of different papers on distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases, The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A Scalable Distributed File System." How can you not love "Frangipani" as a word?
