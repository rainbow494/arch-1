The topic of his talk is an intuitive understanding of the cloud and why it's the best thing ever. 

At about 6:30 into the video Scott is at his standup comic best when he recounts a story of a talk [Adrian Cockroft](https://twitter.com/adrianco) gave on Netflix’s move to SSDs. An audience member energetically questioned the move to SSDs saying they had high failure rates and how moving to SSDs was a stupid idea.

To which Mr. Cockroft replies:

> That's not my problem, I'm renting them.

Scott selected the ideal illustration of the high level of abstraction the cloud provides. If you are new to the cloud that's a very hard idea to grasp. "That's not my problem, I'm renting them" is the perfect mantra when you find yourself worried about things you don't need to be worried about anymore.
