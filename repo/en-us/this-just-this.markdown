    In response to an honest comment about some of Instagram's rather "ordinary engineering choices", mikeyk (Co-founder @ Instagram) had what I consider the [perfect response](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9894975):     

>     We (at IG) aren't claiming to be doing revolutionary things on infrastructure--**but one thing I found super valuable when scaling Instagram in the early days was having access to stories from other companies on how they've scaled**. That's the spirit in which I encourage our engineers to blog about our DB scaling, our search infra, etc--I think the more open we are (as a company, but more broadly as an industry) about technical approaches + solutions, the better off we'll be.    

    This could be the anthem for HS and is a key reason our industry continues to [get better](http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/7/6/how-do-we-explain-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-it.html). And in case you are interested, here are just a few of those stories from Instagram:
